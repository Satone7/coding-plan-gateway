# Specification Quality Checklist: E2E Docker Testing Environment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | Spec focuses on user value without implementation details |
| Requirement Completeness | PASS | All requirements are testable and unambiguous |
| Feature Readiness | PASS | All scenarios and criteria are well-defined |

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/rainbow.clarify` or `/rainbow.design`
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear from the user description
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for implicit requirements
