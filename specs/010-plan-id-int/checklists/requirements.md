- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/rainbow.clarify` or `/rainbow.design`
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed - all requirements are clear from context
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions (max integer, concurrency, gaps)
- Migration story addresses backward compatibility concerns
